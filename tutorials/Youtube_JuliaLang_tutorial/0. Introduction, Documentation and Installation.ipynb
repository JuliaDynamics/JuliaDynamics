    "## Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "**DynamicalSystems.jl** is a registered package. On Julia REPL v1.0 or latest you only have to type `]add DynamicalSystems` to install its features. You should also install `PyPlot` which we use for plotting in some notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, the module `InteractiveChaos` (see below) is currently in alpha and thus not registered. You have to add it via the command `]add https://github.com/JuliaDynamics/InteractiveChaos.jl` which will follow the master branch for it.\n",
